  - Switch to using Alien::Build / alienfile to check and install Gnuplot.
  - Alien::Gnuplot is now a subclass of Alien::Base.
  - Remove interactive installation option for using system package manager.
    The build now gives hints on what command to run instead.
  - Add check for broken Gnuplot pipe IPC on Windows for versions in the
    exclusive range ( 5.2.8, 5.4.6 ). See <https://github.com/PDLPorters/PDL-Graphics-Gnuplot/issues/79>
    for more information.
  - Can now download then build Gnuplot from source on non-MSWin32 platforms
    and download then install the pre-built Gnuplot binaries on MSWin32. GH#2.
  - API change: load_gnuplot() is no longer called when loading the module
    with `require` or `do`. It is instead called by `import()`. This means
    that the usual `use Alien::Gnuplot;` should continue to work.
